-- | Describes operations that can be performed on logging backend except its

class LoggingBackend b where
    -- | If backend is using files/network to store/send log messages, then by
    -- calling this function it should reopen file or network connection.
    --
    -- When log files being rotated it is necessary to reopen it to finalize
    -- the swap of new and old log file. Similarly after detecting network
    -- issues and/or changing configuration at run-time, backend needs to
    -- create new network connection and deallocate the old one.
    reload :: b -> IO ()

    -- | Writing a log message using the specified logging backend.
    pushLogStr :: b -> LogStr -> IO ()

    -- | Same as 'pushLogStr', but newline is appended to the log message.
    pushLogStrLn :: b -> LogStr -> IO ()

    -- | Flush any log messages in a buffer awaiting to be written/sent/etc.
    flush :: b -> IO ()

    -- | Perform 'flush' and release any acquired resources. Logging backend
    -- may not be used after this step.
